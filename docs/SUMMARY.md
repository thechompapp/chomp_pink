Please create a comprehensive and very specific project summary that would allow another AI assistant with no prior context to continue this development work seamlessly. Include:
The project's purpose and core functionality
Key technologies, frameworks, and libraries we've used
The current architecture and component structure.
Explain the core functions of all major files.
Explain the purpose of all major functions
The major files and a very short sentence of its purpose.
Implementation details of major features completed so far
Known issues, limitations, or technical debt
Immediate next steps and future development plans
Any critical design decisions or tradeoffs made
Also, give a directory structure for the next developer’s knowledge
Please build out API documentation
Please offer refactoring strategies and opportunities 
Please also identify any errors you see in the codebase that need fixing - do not write code snippets - just describe/explain specifically.
Lastly, please built a software architecture diagram of this program for the next developer  Show how each file is relational to each other to pinpoint  which files are connected to diagnose the problem Please also map out every part of this program and point to its flows.  The goal here is to ensure that everything we’ve written (every service, hook, controller, UI element, etc) has a purpose and is interconnected correctly.  I want to also eliminate / delete / retire anything that’s not being used. Then give your feedback
