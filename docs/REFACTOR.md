Okay, let's outline a strategy to refactor the Bulk Add feature.

Given the presence of multiple files like src/pages/BulkAdd/index.jsx, BulkAddRefactored.jsx, BulkAddNew.jsx, and BulkAddSimple.jsx, the first step is to consolidate and then break down the chosen primary component. The goal is to improve SRP, cohesion, readability, maintainability, and testability.

I. Phase 1: Consolidation and Understanding (Pre-computation/Analysis)

Determine the Active BulkAdd Component:

Identify which of the BulkAdd*.jsx files (index.jsx, BulkAddRefactored.jsx, BulkAddNew.jsx, BulkAddSimple.jsx) is currently in use or represents the most complete/latest version. This will be our primary target for refactoring. Let's assume for this strategy that src/pages/BulkAdd/index.jsx is the main entry point, and it either contains all logic or delegates to one of the other BulkAdd*.jsx files. If there's a src/components/BulkAdd/BulkAdd.jsx, that might be the core UI logic.
Action: Review src/App.jsx or relevant routing configuration to see which component is mapped to the bulk add route. Also, check src/pages/BulkAdd/index.jsx to see if it re-exports or wraps another component.
Understand the Current Workflow & Responsibilities:

Manually trace the existing Bulk Add feature's workflow. This typically involves:
Input: How does the user provide data? (e.g., text area, file upload).
Parsing: How is the input (e.g., text, CSV) processed into structured data? (See src/utils/bulkAddUtils.js).
Data Enrichment/Validation (Client-side):
Are there calls to external services like Google Places API for validation or details? (See src/pages/BulkAdd/PlaceSelectionDialog.jsx, src/services/placesService.js).
What local validation rules are applied?
Review: Is there a step where the user reviews parsed/enriched data? (See src/pages/BulkAdd/ReviewMode.jsx).
Submission: How is data sent to the backend? (Batch or individual requests? See src/hooks/useBulkAddProcessor.js or V2, src/services/restaurantService.js, src/services/dishService.js).
Results & Error Handling: How are success/failure statuses for individual items and overall batch displayed?
Identify Key Logic Blocks:

Within the chosen main Bulk Add component and its direct helpers/hooks (like useBulkAddProcessor.js), identify distinct blocks of code responsible for:
UI rendering (input forms, review tables, result displays).
State management (input text, parsed items, selected places, submission status, errors).
Input parsing and initial validation.
Interaction with Google Places API (search, selection).
Backend API communication (batch submission, error handling).
Displaying progress and results.
II. Phase 2: Refactoring Strategy - Separation of Concerns

The core idea is to break down the monolithic Bulk Add feature into smaller, more manageable, and single-responsibility units. This involves creating new components, hooks, and utility modules.

File Structure Proposal:

Create a dedicated directory for the refactored Bulk Add feature if it doesn't strictly follow this already: src/features/BulkAdd/
components/: For UI-specific sub-components.
hooks/: For custom hooks managing specific logic or state.
utils/: For pure utility functions related to parsing, validation, etc. (Can also leverage existing src/utils/bulkAddUtils.js).
services/: If specific API orchestration for bulk add is needed beyond generic services.
index.jsx: The main page component for Bulk Add, orchestrating the workflow.
Breakdown into Components (UI Layer):

BulkAddPage.jsx (e.g., src/features/BulkAdd/index.jsx or the refactored src/pages/BulkAdd/index.jsx):
Responsibility: Main container for the Bulk Add workflow. Manages the overall state of the process (e.g., current step: input, review, processing, results). Orchestrates interactions between child components.
LoC Reduction: Significantly reduced as most UI and logic moves to child components/hooks.
components/BulkInputForm.jsx:
Responsibility: Handles the UI for data input (e.g., text area for pasting lines, file upload button). Emits raw input data.
components/BulkReviewStage.jsx:
Responsibility: Displays the parsed and potentially enriched items for user review. Allows for corrections or selections (e.g., if multiple Google Places matches). Handles interactions related to individual items before final submission. This might incorporate or manage instances of PlaceSelectionDialog.jsx.
components/BulkResultsDisplay.jsx:
Responsibility: Shows the status of the submission for each item and any overall summary/errors.
components/PlaceSelectionDialogWrapper.jsx (if PlaceSelectionDialog.jsx is generic):
Responsibility: A wrapper around src/pages/BulkAdd/PlaceSelectionDialog.jsx (or move it to src/features/BulkAdd/components/) to adapt it specifically for the bulk context, managing its state (open/closed, current item being resolved) and callbacks.
Extract Logic into Custom Hooks (Logic & State Layer):

hooks/useInputParser.js:
Responsibility: Takes raw input (text or file content) and parses it into a structured array of items based on defined rules (e.g., "Dish Name @ Restaurant Name"). Could leverage src/utils/bulkAddUtils.js.
Input: Raw text/file.
Output: Array of parsed items with initial status.
hooks/usePlaceResolver.js:
Responsibility: Manages fetching place details from Google Places API for an array of parsed items. Handles queuing, API calls (via placesService), and updating items with place information or marking them for disambiguation. Manages the state for the PlaceSelectionDialogWrapper.
Input: Array of parsed items.
Output: Array of items enriched with place data or needing resolution.
hooks/useBulkSubmitter.js:
Responsibility: Takes an array of validated and enriched items and handles batch submission to the backend API. Manages submission progress, handles API responses/errors for each item, and updates item statuses.
Input: Array of items ready for submission.
Output: Submission status, results, errors.
Consolidate/Refactor useBulkAddProcessor.js and useBulkAddProcessorV2.js: The new hooks above would replace much of the functionality in these. The main BulkAddPage.jsx might have a top-level hook useBulkAddWorkflow.js that orchestrates these smaller, more focused hooks.
Refine Utility Functions (Pure Logic):

Review src/utils/bulkAddUtils.js:
Responsibility: Should contain pure functions for parsing specific line formats, validation rules (that don't require API calls), data transformation, etc.
Ensure functions are small, testable, and have single responsibilities.
API Services (Data Fetching Layer):

Utilize existing services like src/services/restaurantService.js, src/services/dishService.js, and src/services/placesService.js.
If backend has specific batch endpoints for bulk adding, ensure frontend services have corresponding functions.
The useBulkSubmitter.js hook would use these services.
III. Phase 3: Implementation Steps (Iterative)

Setup New Directory Structure: Create src/features/BulkAdd/ and subdirectories.
Start with the Main Page (BulkAddPage.jsx): Define the main steps/states of the bulk add process.
Develop BulkInputForm.jsx and useInputParser.js:
Move UI for input to BulkInputForm.jsx.
Move parsing logic to useInputParser.js.
Connect them in BulkAddPage.jsx.
Develop BulkReviewStage.jsx and usePlaceResolver.js:
Move UI for reviewing items to BulkReviewStage.jsx.
Implement PlaceSelectionDialogWrapper.jsx.
Move Google Places API interaction logic to usePlaceResolver.js.
Connect in BulkAddPage.jsx.
Develop BulkResultsDisplay.jsx and useBulkSubmitter.js:
Move UI for displaying results to BulkResultsDisplay.jsx.
Move backend submission logic to useBulkSubmitter.js.
Connect in BulkAddPage.jsx.
State Management:
Prefer local component state or custom hook state.
If global state is absolutely necessary (e.g., for notifications not tied to the page), use Zustand stores (like useAuthStore, useUIStateStore).
Ensure adherence to React best practices for state updates, memoization (useMemo, useCallback), and effect dependencies.
Testing:
Write unit tests for utility functions (bulkAddUtils.js).
Write unit/integration tests for custom hooks (e.g., using React Testing Library with renderHook).
Write integration tests for components, mocking services and hooks where appropriate.
Ensure E2E tests (like those in src/__tests__/e2e/features/bulk-add-e2e-test.js) are updated or created.
IV. Expected Benefits:

Improved SRP: Each component and hook will have a clear, single responsibility.
Enhanced Cohesion: Logic related to a specific task (e.g., parsing, place resolution) will be grouped.
Better Readability & Navigability: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand.
Increased Maintainability & Reduced Cognitive Load: Changes to one part of the feature are less likely to break others. Easier for new developers.
Improved Testability: Smaller units are easier to test in isolation.
Reduced Merge Conflicts: Smaller files generally lead to fewer conflicts if different developers work on different aspects of the bulk add feature.
This strategy provides a structured approach to untangling the complexities of the Bulk Add feature. The key is iterative development and testing at each stage. Remember to check the existing documentation (src/docs/BulkAddFeature.md) and update it as you refactor.
