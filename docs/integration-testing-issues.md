# Integration Testing Issues in Doof Application

## Overview
This document outlines the issues encountered while setting up and running integration tests for the Doof application, specifically focusing on the health endpoint tests. The primary challenges revolve around CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration, test environment setup, and API endpoint accessibility.

## Executive Summary

The primary integration testing issues for the Doof application stem from CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration problems within the Node.js and JSDOM test environment. The test environment rejects custom headers and CORS-related headers, leading to endpoint inaccessibility and network errors. Additionally, initial port configuration issues (using port 3000 instead of 5001) and JSDOM's limitations with XMLHttpRequest's CORS implementation further complicate testing.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **CORS Implementation in Test Environment**
   - JSDOM's XMLHttpRequest implementation enforces strict CORS rules
   - Custom headers (e.g., `X-Test-Request`) are rejected by default
   - Preflight requests fail due to header restrictions

2. **Configuration Issues**
   - Incorrect port configuration (3000 vs 5001)
   - Mismatch between test and server CORS settings
   - Lack of environment-specific configurations

3. **Test Environment Limitations**
   - JSDOM's incomplete browser API implementation
   - Differences between test environment and actual browser behavior
   - Restrictive default security settings

## Current State

### Test Configuration
- **Test Framework**: Vitest
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Test Environment**: Node.js with JSDOM
- **Backend Server**: Running on port 5001
- **Test File**: `tests/integration/simplified-health.test.js`

### Observed Issues

1. **CORS Configuration Problems**
   - The test environment is running in a Node.js context with JSDOM
   - Browser-like CORS restrictions are being enforced
   - Custom headers (like `X-Test-Request`) are being rejected by the test environment

2. **Endpoint Accessibility**
   - Backend server is running on port 5001 (`http://localhost:5001`)
   - Health endpoint is accessible at `/api/health`
   - Initial tests were failing due to incorrect port configuration (3000 instead of 5001)

3. **Test Environment Limitations**
   - JSDOM's implementation of XMLHttpRequest has limitations with CORS
   - Certain headers that are normally allowed in browsers are rejected in the test environment
   - The test environment is more restrictive than actual browser behavior

## Error Analysis

### Error 1: CORS Headers Rejection
```
Error: Headers Access-Control-Allow-Origin,Access-Control-Allow-Methods,Access-Control-Allow-Headers forbidden
```
**Cause**: The test environment is rejecting CORS-related headers that are typically set by the server.

### Error 2: Network Errors
```
AxiosError: Network Error
```
**Cause**: The test environment is unable to establish a connection to the API endpoint, often due to CORS preflight request failures.

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Simplified Headers**
   - Removed all non-essential headers from test requests
   - Kept only the `Accept: application/json` header

2. **Direct API Testing**
   - Verified API accessibility using `curl`
   - Confirmed the API is running and accessible on port 5001

3. **Test Environment Configuration**
   - Updated base URL to use the correct port (5001)
   - Simplified axios instance configuration
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term Fixes
1. **Update Test Configuration**
   - Use minimal headers in test requests (e.g., only `Accept: application/json`)
   - Ensure all tests use the correct base URL (`http://localhost:5001/api`)
   - Remove custom headers that trigger CORS preflight
   - Implement proper error handling for test failures

2. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Add pre-test checks to verify backend server availability
   - Implement health check endpoints for test environment verification
   - Document the test setup process clearly

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Use mocks for unit tests to isolate components
   - Reserve real API calls for integration and end-to-end tests
   - Implement proper test cleanup after each test case

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Test-Specific API Endpoints**
   - Create dedicated test endpoints with relaxed CORS policies
   - Use environment variables to manage different configurations
   - Implement feature flags for test-specific behaviors

2. **Containerized Development**
   - Dockerize the application and test environment
   - Ensure consistent environments across development and CI/CD
   - Implement proper service discovery and networking

3. **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement contract testing with tools like Pact
   - Set up automated API documentation testing
   - Add performance and load testing capabilities

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automate test execution in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement test result reporting and notifications
   - Set up test coverage requirements

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Verify API accessibility with minimal headers
2. [ ] Update test configuration to use correct endpoints
3. [ ] Implement proper error handling for test failures
4. [ ] Add documentation for running tests
5. [ ] Consider adding CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
