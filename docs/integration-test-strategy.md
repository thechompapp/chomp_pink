# Chomp Application Integration Test Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for implementing internal integration tests across the Chomp application. The goal is to verify that all key components interact correctly, reducing errors from component miscommunications and improving overall application stability.

## 1. Current Architecture Assessment

The Chomp application consists of the following major components:

### Frontend
- **UI Components**: ListCard, AddToListModal, BulkAdd, etc.
- **Hooks**: useBulkAddProcessor, useAuth, etc.
- **Services**: placeService, listService, apiClient, etc.
- **State Management**: Context providers, local state

### Backend
- **Controllers**: Places, Lists, Auth, etc.
- **Services**: Business logic layers
- **Data Access**: Database interactions
- **Middleware**: Authentication, error handling, etc.

## 2. Critical User Flows

Based on application usage and previous issues, the following user flows are identified as critical:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Login, session persistence, token refresh
2. **List Management**: Creating, viewing, and managing lists
3. **Item Management**: Adding items to lists (single and bulk)
4. **Following Lists**: Following/unfollowing other users' lists
5. **Offline Mode**: Operation during connectivity issues
6. **Search & Discovery**: Finding restaurants and places

## 3. Prioritization Matrix

| Feature Area | Complexity | Error History | User Impact | Priority |
|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Authentication | High | High | Critical | 1 |
| Bulk Add | High | High | High | 2 |
| List Management | Medium | Medium | Critical | 3 |
| Item Management | Medium | Medium | High | 4 |
| Following Lists | Low | Medium | Medium | 5 |
| Offline Mode | High | High | High | 6 |
| Search & Discovery | Medium | Low | Medium | 7 |

## 4. Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Establish testing infrastructure
- Implement core utility tests
- Create baseline API connectivity tests
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

### Phase 2: Critical Features (Weeks 3-5)
- Implement Bulk Add integration tests
- Implement List Management integration tests
- Implement Item Management integration tests

### Phase 3: Secondary Features (Weeks 6-8)
- Implement Following Lists integration tests
- Implement Offline Mode integration tests
- Implement Search & Discovery integration tests

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage (Weeks 9-12)
- Fill gaps in test coverage
- Implement edge case testing
- Performance testing for critical flows

## 5. Testing Tools & Frameworks

### Frontend
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing

### Backend
- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **Supertest**: API testing
- **Testcontainers**: Database testing

## 6. Test Types

### Component Integration Tests
- Verify that related components work together correctly
- Focus on props passing, event handling, and state updates

### Service Integration Tests
- Verify that services correctly interact with APIs
- Test error handling and retry logic

### Hook Integration Tests
- Verify that hooks correctly manage state and side effects
- Test interactions with services and other hooks

### API Integration Tests
- Verify that frontend and backend communicate correctly
- Test authentication, error handling, and data formats

### End-to-End Flow Tests
- Verify complete user flows from UI to database and back
- Test realistic user scenarios

## 7. Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
- Organize tests by feature area
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup and teardown

### Test Data
- Use realistic test data
- Create test data factories
- Clean up test data after tests

### Mocking Strategy
- Minimize mocks in integration tests
- Use real implementations where possible
- Mock external dependencies (Google Places API, etc.)

## 8. Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Maintain a dashboard of test coverage
- Set up alerts for test failures
- Regularly review and update tests

## 9. Maintenance Plan

- Review tests quarterly
- Update tests when features change
- Remove obsolete tests
- Add tests for new features

## 10. Success Metrics

- 80%+ integration test coverage for critical paths
- Reduction in production bugs by 50%
- Faster development cycles
- Increased developer confidence
