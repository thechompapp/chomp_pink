## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### Code Modifications
```diff
// Before (deprecated)
- const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuthStore(state => ({
-   user: state.user,
-   isAuthenticated: state.isAuthenticated,
- }));

// After (modern)
+ const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

### Import Updates
```diff
// Before
- import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/useAuthStore';
- import { useShallow } from 'zustand/react/shallow';

// After  
+ import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/auth/AuthContext';
```

### Test Updates
```diff
// Before
- vi.mock('@/stores/useAuthStore', () => ({
-   default: vi.fn(() => mockAuthStore)
- }));

// After
+ vi.mock('@/contexts/auth/AuthContext', () => ({
+   useAuth: vi.fn(() => mockAuthStore)
+ }));
```
