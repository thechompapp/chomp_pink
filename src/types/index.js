/* REMOVED: All TypeScript syntax */
// This file re-exported types. In JavaScript, it might export validation functions
// or constants, or it might be unnecessary and can be removed if not used.

// export * from './List.js'; // These exports likely won't work as expected in JS unless those files export values/functions
// export * from './User.js';
// export * from './Places.js';

// REMOVED: interface DishDetail { ... }

// If this file is no longer needed, it can be deleted.
// If you were using it to group exports, you might need to adjust imports elsewhere.
