# Doof E2E Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for end-to-end (E2E) testing of the Doof application. The goal is to ensure that all functionalities are thoroughly tested against the real API while optimizing test execution speed and reliability.

## Current Status

As of May 23, 2025, we have:

1. **Working Endpoints**:
   - Health endpoint (`/api/health`) - Fully functional and tested

2. **Non-Working Endpoints**:
   - Authentication endpoints - Issues with registration (500 error) and login (401 error)
   - Other endpoints - Not yet tested or implemented

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Backend server runs on port 5001
   - Frontend runs on port 5173
   - Test suite is configured to connect to the correct backend port

## Testing Approach

### 1. Layered Testing

We'll implement a layered approach to testing:

- **Level 1: API Availability Tests** - Verify that endpoints exist and respond with the correct status codes
- **Level 2: Functional Tests** - Test the business logic and functionality of each endpoint
- **Level 3: Integration Tests** - Test the interaction between different endpoints and features
- **Level 4: End-to-End Flows** - Test complete user journeys across multiple endpoints

### 2. Test Data Management

- Use a dedicated test database that is reset before each test run
- Create test users and data programmatically as part of the test setup
- Clean up all test data after tests complete

### 3. Authentication Strategy

- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated access to endpoints
- Verify token generation, validation, and expiration
- Test different user roles and permissions

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Keep test timeouts reasonable (3-5 seconds for most tests)
- Use parallel test execution where possible
- Minimize database operations during tests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic API Connectivity (Completed)

- ✅ Configure test suite to connect to the correct backend port
- ✅ Implement health endpoint tests
- ✅ Create script to start the backend server

### Phase 2: Authentication Testing (In Progress)

- ✅ Create basic authentication endpoint tests
- 🔄 Debug and fix authentication issues
- 🔄 Implement token management and validation tests

### Phase 3: Core Feature Testing (Pending)

- 📝 Implement restaurant management tests
- 📝 Implement dish management tests
- 📝 Implement user profile tests
- 📝 Implement search functionality tests

### Phase 4: Advanced Feature Testing (Pending)

- 📝 Implement list management tests
- 📝 Implement hashtag functionality tests
- 📝 Implement engagement feature tests
- 📝 Implement location-based filtering tests

### Phase 5: Admin and Analytics Testing (Pending)

- 📝 Implement admin operation tests
- 📝 Implement analytics endpoint tests
- 📝 Implement trending data tests

## Known Issues and Next Steps

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Registration endpoint returns 500 error - Need to check server logs for details
   - Login endpoint returns 401 error - Need to verify correct credentials
   - Auth status endpoint doesn't return expected structure

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Need to ensure test database is properly configured and accessible

3. **Test User Creation**:
   - Need to implement a reliable way to create and manage test users

## Next Steps

1. Debug authentication issues by examining server logs
2. Create a database setup script for test data
3. Implement more robust error handling in tests
4. Expand test coverage to other endpoints

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Doof application. By following this structured approach, we can identify and fix issues early in the development process and ensure a high-quality user experience.
